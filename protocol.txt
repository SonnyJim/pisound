Protocol notes:
===============
0x3FDD - Sound board writes 0x01 when it has data to transmit to the main CPU
0x3FDC - Location for sound commands/data to be passed back and forth

On boot main CPU tries to read 0x3FDD 100 times, then reads 0x3FDC, 
It then reads 0x3FDD a couple more times
then sends a version control cmd to the sound board 
reads 0x3FDD another 8 or so times
sends another version control cmd
reads 0x3FDD another 8 or so times
Reads 0x3FDC
Once the sound board writes 02 to 0x3FDC, the main CPU stops reading 0x3FDD

Main CPU sends 0x00 (? init ?)
Main CPU sends 0x79 (volume set)
Main CPU sends 0x0C (volume level 12)
Main CPU sends 0xF3 (Checksum, just a bitflip of the volume)


Sound codes @ 3fdc for TZ_94H
===========
73      = Break things with a long sustain?
2f + x  = Play song x quantised to bar

ca/cb are unused tunes

Set 3fdd to any non-zero value and the sound board resets

ww_l5 uses 7B to fetch the sound board version, the quantised music starts at 31
