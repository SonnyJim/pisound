Notes:
======
On boot main CPU tries to read 0x3FDD 100 times, then reads 0x3FDC, 
It then reads 0x3FDD a couple more times
then sends a version control cmd to the sound board 
reads 0x3FDD another 8 or so times
sends another version control cmd
reads 0x3FDD another 8 or so times
Reads 0x3FDC
Once the sound board writes 02 to 0x3FDC, the main CPU stops reading 0x3FDD

Main CPU sends 0x00 (? init ?)
Main CPU sends 0x79 (volume set)
Main CPU sends 0x0C (???)
Main CPU sends 0xF3 (????)
